# Modelling Power Consumption based on Resource Utilization

This source code analysis and modelling energy consumption based on hardware utilization counters (e.g., memory usage, CPU occupation, number of I/O operations per interval) extracted from Unix-like operating systems.

We applied three different techniques to model energy consumption:

- Linear Regression
- Regression Tree
- Neural Artificial Network (Multilayer Perceptron)

The bestest model has an accuracy greater than 99.0%. For correlation analysis, we applied a metric that has equitability and generality properties.
